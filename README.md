## Why?

This app was built to highlight some limitations of floating-point arithmetic, and illustrate how a library like [big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/) can help.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also uses Redux, hooks, and CSS grid layout.
