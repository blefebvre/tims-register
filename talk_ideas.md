# Monetary values in JS

## intro

- used to work at tims
- drivethru performance is critical, stores are measured against each other
- fastest employees were moved to drive thru
- i was put on drive thru (#humblebrag)

- large coffee at the time cost 1.31
- from a toonie, this is .69c change which is a pain in the ass amount of change
- this was before credit cards were accepted at tims
- still had pennies, too

- what I would do is have .69c ready at the window, in case the person was paying with a toonie
- _if not_, you have already opened the cash so you cannot use the built in calculator to tell you the change
- have to think fast

- sometimes folks would be helpful
- ie. pay 2.01 which is 70c change instead

- another example, bill of $7.36 and pays a $10 = $2.64 change
- $10.11 is better = 2.75

- could imagine my surprise years later learning that computers _struggle_ big time with this type of math!
